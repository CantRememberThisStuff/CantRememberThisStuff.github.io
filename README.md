# Can't Remember This Stuff

Bunch of cheatsheets and other things to help me remember how to do
things. Work in progress and updated frequently.

You might have thought there were already enough of these, but I felt like I wanted a cheatsheet that allowed me quick access to all kinds of commands. I really liked the selection method that WADComs used and decided that would be suitable for this interactive sheet.

If you use any of this, use it responsibly, stick to the laws and get
permissions from your targets. I am not responsible for anything that
might go wrong when using these resources.
