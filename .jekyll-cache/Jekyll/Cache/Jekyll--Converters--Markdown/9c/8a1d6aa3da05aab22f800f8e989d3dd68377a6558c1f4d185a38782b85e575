I"®<p>targetedKerberoast is a Python script that can, like many others (e.g. GetUserSPNs.py), print ‚Äúkerberoast‚Äù hashes for user accounts that have a SPN set. This tool brings the following additional feature: for each user without SPNs, it tries to set one (abuse of a write permission on the servicePrincipalName attribute), print the ‚Äúkerberoast‚Äù hash, and delete the temporary SPN set for that operation.</p>
