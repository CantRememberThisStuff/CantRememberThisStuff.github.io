Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.</p>

<p>BloodHound.py is a Python based ingestor for BloodHound, based on Impacket. It allows you to remotely collect data for bloodhound by querying LDAP</p>
